BlzMovies
=========

Just a simple Qt application for Symbian platform.

It uses the TheMovieDb.org API to search information about movies.
The application uses Qt to parse XML, connect to web services,
download images etc. 

It's a good example of how to make a Qt-based application for
Symbian platform. You can see how to handle a widget stack,
how to set the key-based screen shortcuts and more.

Known bugs
----------

I don't know why, but in the movie details I can't scroll.
Looks like a problem with QScrollArea and Symbian. Maybe.
